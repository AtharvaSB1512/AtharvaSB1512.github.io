        <div class="header"><h1>â€¢ Different investment options<h1></div>  
        <div class="header"><h2>1) Bank Fixed Deposit (FD)<h2></div>
          <div>A bank fixed deposit is considered a comparatively safer (than equity or mutual funds) choice for investing in India.
            The interest rate earned is added to one's income and is taxed as per one's income slab.<div>
        <div class="header"><h2>2) Bitcoin<h2></div>
          <div>They are a cryptocurrency and a digital payment system. They are just like normal currency but without any physical form. It is completely managed electronically. They are used for secure and instant transfer of value to anywhere in the world.
            In India, you can buy bitcoins from some trusted Bitcoin apps.
            Bitcoin is quite risky as it is very fluctuating and there is no proper guidelines by Indian government over it's legality but it can offer quite high returns<div>
        <div class="header"><h2>3) Bonds<h2></div>
            <div>A bond is a fixed income instrument that represents a loan made by an investor to a borrower (typically corporate or governmental).
                They are typically safer than stocks and mutual fund and give higer returns than FD</div>
        <div class="header"><h2>4) Gold<h2></div>
            <div>Many banks sell gold coins now-a-days. An alternate way of owning gold is via paper gold. Investment in paper gold is more cost-effective and can be done through gold ETFs. Such investment (buying and selling) happens on a stock exchange (NSE or BSE) with gold as the underlying asset. Investing in Sovereign Gold Bonds is another option to own paper-gold. An investor can also invest via gold mutual funds.</div>
        <div class="header"><h2>5) Mutual Fund<h2></div>
            <div>1)Equity mutual funds
                Equity mutual fund schemes predominantly invest in equity stocks.
                
                2)Debt mutual funds
                Debt mutual fund schemes are suitable for investors who want steady returns. They are less volatile and, hence, considered less risky compared to equity funds. Debt mutual funds primarily invest in fixed-interest generating securities like corporate bonds, government securities, treasury bills, commercial paper and other money market instruments.</div>
        <div class="header"><h2>6) National Pension System (NPS)<h2></div>
            <div>The National Pension System is a long term retirement - focused investment product managed by the Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA).
                It is a mix of equity, fixed deposits, corporate bonds, liquid funds and government funds, among others. Based on your risk appetite, you can decide how much of your money can be invested in equities through NPS. Read more about NPS.</div>
        <div class="header"><h2>7)Pradhan Mantri Vaya Vandana Yojana (PMVVY)<h2></div>
            <div>PMVVY is for senior citizens aged 60 years and above to provide them an assured return of 7.4 per cent per annum. The scheme offers pension income payable monthly, quarterly, half-yearly or yearly as opted.</div>
        <div class="header"><h2>8) Public Provident Fund (PPF)<h2></div>
            <div>Since PPF has a long tenure of 15 years, the impact of compounding of tax-free interest is huge, especially in the later years. Further, since the interest earned and the principal invested is backed by sovereign guarantee, it makes it a safe investment.</div>
        <div class="header"><h2>9) Real Estate <h2></div>
            <div>The house that you live in is for self-consumption and should never be considered as an investment. If you do not intend to live in it, the second property you buy can be your investment.
                The location of the property is the single most important factor that will determine the value of your property and also the rental that it can earn.</div>
        <div class="header"><h2>10) Senior Citizens Saving Scheme (SCSS) <h2></div>
            <div>Probably the first choice of most retirees, the Senior Citizens' Saving Scheme is a must-have in their investment portfolios. As the name suggests, only senior citizens or early retirees can invest in this scheme. SCSS can be availed from a post office or a bank by anyone above 60.</div>
        <div class="header"><h2>11) Stock Market <h2></div>
            <div>Investing in stocks might not be everyone's cup of tea as it's a volatile asset class and there is no guarantee of returns. Further, not only is it difficult to pick the right stock, timing your entry and exit is also not easy. The only silver lining is that over long periods, equity has been able to deliver higher than inflation-adjusted returns compared to all other asset classes.</div>
